### DesktopSaver keeps track of your Windows desktop icon positions over time

If your icon positions are disturbed after a video resolution change, an explorer crash, changing video device settings, docking your laptop, or for any other reason, DesktopSaver's system tray icon can restore their original positions in a single click.

Works with both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and later.
